# Introduction


# Part 1: Basics


## Text

All the basic R Markdown stuff holds for text.


#### Emphasis

`*italic*   **bold**`

`_italic_   __bold__`

#### Headers

`# Header 1`

`## Header 2`

`### Header 3`

#### Lists

Unordered List:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
```

Ordered List:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
```


#### Links

Use a plain http address or add a link to a phrase:

```
http://example.com

[linked phrase](http://example.com)
```

#### Images

Images on the web or local files in the same directory:

```
![](http://example.com/logo.png)

![optional caption text](figures/img.png)
```

#### Blockquotes

A friend once said:

> It's always better to give
> than to receive.

Plain Code Blocks

Plain code blocks are displayed in a fixed-width font but not evaulated

```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
```

#### Inline Code

```
We defined the `add` function to
compute the sum of two numbers.
```

#### LaTeX Equations

Inline equation:

```
$equation$
```
Display equation:

```
$$ equation $$
```


#### Horizontal Rule / Page Break

Three or more asterisks or dashes:
```
******

------
```

#### Tables

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Reference Style Links and Images
```



#### Manual Line Breaks

End a line with two or more spaces, or just hit return twice.

```
Roses are red,  
Violets are blue.
```

#### Miscellaneous

```
superscript^2^

~~strikethrough~~
```



## Code

Time for code! Again, basic R Markdown is the starting point.

```{r}
cat("```{r}
summary(cars$dist)
summary(cars$speed)
```")
```

Inline R Code

```{r}
cat("
There were `r nrow(cars)` cars studied
")
```



Try a chunk yourself!

```{r}
cat("```{r}
x = sample(letters, 5)

x
``` ")
```


Don't see the code? By default, Distill sets `echo = FALSE`, which means the code will not be shown. Why? The primary goal of the format is *communication of ideas*, not code.  Just switch it to `TRUE`

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

x = rlogis(1000)

qplot(sort(x), plogis(sort(x)), ylab = 'Probability', geom = 'line')
```

Already looks nice! By default, highlighting is done using colors optimized for accessibility and color contrast.

## Tables


Easily create a nice table without the fuss!

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rmarkdown::paged_table(mtcars)
```

## Visualization


### Distill Layouts

- l-body
- l-body-outset
- l-page
- l-screen

#### l-body

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 15)) %>%
  setView(lng  = 174.768,
          lat  = -36.852,
          zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng   = 174.768,
             lat   = -36.852,
             popup = "The birthplace of R")
```



Note: If you are like me, you will probably never remember these names, so be prepared to look it up.

#### l-body-outset

```{r, layout = 'l-body-outset'}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 15)) %>%
  setView(lng  = 174.768,
          lat  = -36.852,
          zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng   = 174.768,
             lat   = -36.852,
             popup = "The birthplace of R")
```

#### l-page

```{r, layout = 'l-page'}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 15)) %>%
  setView(lng  = 174.768,
          lat  = -36.852,
          zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng   = 174.768,
             lat   = -36.852,
             popup = "The birthplace of R")
```


#### l-screen

```{r, layout = 'l-screen'}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 15)) %>%
  setView(lng  = 174.768,
          lat  = -36.852,
          zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng   = 174.768,
             lat   = -36.852,
             popup = "The birthplace of R")
```



Control: Use the fig.asp chunk option to modify the aspect ratio.

```{r aspect-ratio-demo, fig.cap='test figure', layout = 'l-body-outset', fig.asp=.2}
library(leaflet)

leaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 2, maxZoom = 15)) %>%
  setView(lng  = 174.768,
          lat  = -36.852,
          zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng   = 174.768,
             lat   = -36.852,
             popup = "The birthplace of R")
```


Reference figures by chunk name, **as long as they also have a caption**.  For example, if the chunk is named 'aspect-ratio-demo', then `\@ref(fig:aspect-ratio-demo)` would reference it. For example, see figure \@ref(fig:aspect-ratio-demo).


### Other stuff

Note that for smaller screens, you may not see a difference for the larger sizes.


# Part 2: Miscellaneous Cool Stuff

## Citations

Create a file of your chosen type and point to it in the YAML.

Text/inline code:
`Look at this citation- @clark-models, or these [@clark-pds; @clark-iml; @brms].`

Result:

Look at this citation- @clark-models, or these [@clark-pds; @clark-iml; @brms].


### Making your work more easily citable

Include in your YAML:

- `author`
- `date`
- `citation_url`

See the bottom of this page!


## Footnotes and asides

Here is a footnote[^footnote].  They can be clicked or just hovered over.


How to do it:

`Here is a footnote[^footnote].  They can be clicked or just hovered over.`
`[^footnote]: Hey! It's a footnote!`   $\rightarrow$  *This can be anywhere in the document.*


Asides are one of the best features of distill.

<aside> You never have to use parentheses again!</aside>





[^footnote]: Hey! It's a footnote!
